# Custom Pomodoro

A MAUI Blazor hybrid app with a customizable pomodoro timer. Developed with Windows & *Android devices in mind.

*Disclaimer: A stable Android release is currently unavailable. A glitch currently causes the "release" version to break on Android devices. (This is a bug on the framework's behalf. Also potentially responsible for crashing Android emulators.) Development will be kept with Android in mind should the issue be resolved.

* Selection of previously used timers (for each type of timer).
* Choice of black, gray, or white text for the timer page.
